* Instructions for building juise

** Dependencies

juise depends on the following software packages:

- libxml2
  - home: http://www.xmlsoft.org/index.html
  - download information: http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html

- libxslt
  - home: http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/
  - download information: http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/downloads.html

- libcurl (optional)
  - home: http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
  - download information: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

- libedit (optional)
  - note: libreadline can also be used optionally
  - home: http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/

- lighttpd (optional)
  - home: http://www.lighttpd.net/
  - download information: http://www.lighttpd.net/download
  - note: You'll need to download source for lighttpd and build it,
    but you'll need to make an distinct "build" subdirectory.
        tar zxf lighttpd-src.1.4.28.tgz
        cd lighttpd-src.1.4.28
        mkdir build
        cd build
        ../configure --with-your-own-options
    Then pass these directories to juise's configure script.

If you are fortunate, these libraries are already part of your
installed software base.  If not, you can either install pre-built
packages of these libraries (if your OS supports it), or build the
libraries from scratch.

** Cygwin

Note that cygwin requires GCC4.
