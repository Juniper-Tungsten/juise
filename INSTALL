* Instructions for building juise

** Building lighttpd

You'll need to download source for lighttpd and build it, but you'll
need to make an distinct "build" subdirectory.

tar zxf lighttpd-src.1.4.28.tgz
cd lighttpd-src.1.4.28
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --with-your-own-options


Then pass these directories to juise's configure script.
