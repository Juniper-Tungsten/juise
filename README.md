# JUISE: The JUNOS User Interface Scripting Environment

The JUISE project (the JUNOS User Interface Scripting Environment)
allows scripts to be written, debugged, and executed outside the
normal JUNOS environment.  Users can develop scripts in their desktop
environment, performing the code/test/debug cycle in a more natural
way.  Tools for developers are available, including a debugger, a
profiler, a call-flow tracing mechanism, and trace files.  
The JUNOS-specific extension functions are available for scripts,
allowing access to JUNOS XML data using the normal jcs:invoke and
jcs:execute functions.  Commit scripts can be tested against a JUNOS
device's configuration and the results of those script tested on that
device.
